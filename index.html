      <p class="type-text" data-text="Three years since that one random “😂” turned into the most meaningful part of my life 💖.
      Since the day you replied everything changed ✨.
I didn’t just find someone to talk to 🥺,
I found you 🥰.
      And you? 😳
You’re the most incredible human being I’ve ever known 😍.
You’re kind in ways the world doesn’t deserve, strong in ways you don’t even realize 💪.
      You carry so much in your heart and still manage to give love to everyone around you 💖.
You make people feel seen, heard, safe, especially me 🥺.
You’re beautiful not just in the way you look, but in the way your soul glows 🌷.
You laugh in a way that makes everything feel lighter 😋.
      You care with so much depth even when you pretend you don’t 🤭.
You light up my dark days without even trying ✨.
You’ve held me on my weak days, understood me when I couldn’t even explain myself 😭,
And loved me in ways I never knew I needed. 🥰
      You are not ordinary 🪐.
You are magic in your words, your presence, your heart ❤️.
And every single day I thank the universe that our paths crossed, that I sent that emoji, and that you replied 💌.
      So today, on the day we unknowingly started forever, I just want you to know:
You’re amazing! You’re irreplaceable!
And I’m endlessly proud to call you mine 🤤.
      Happy 3rd Anniversary of Us! 💞
Here’s to many more years of choosing each other, growing together, and falling deeper in love 💋.
      Forever yours. 🥺"></p>

Such a worthless guy I am, then there’s you, so beautiful, so cutu, so pyaari, so fucking obsessed with hamesha. You choose me even though you’re so much of a goddesssss 💖.
That’s what makes you different.
That’s what makes us real.
We’ve argued, we’ve hurt, we’ve misunderstood — but never gave up 🥰.
Every time we fight it’s like the universe tests us, only to remind us we’re stronger than the noise between us 💪.
Every “I’m mad” turns into “I missed you.” 🥺
Every distance turns into a tighter hug even if it’s virtual. 🫂
You don’t walk away when things get hard.
That’s why you’re my comfort zone — You sit with me in the storm even when you’re hurting too 😭.
That’s why you’re my comfort zone, not because everything is always perfect,
but because even when it’s messy, I know you’re still my person ❤️."></p>

      <p class="type-text" data-text="It all began with a ‘😂’...
      Three years ago today, I sent a simple emoji — just a “😂” —
No grand gesture, no plan, just a random moment… and you, a rude reply from you 😈.
      “What’s there to laugh at?” 💢
      That one little question started something I never saw coming ✨.
Something so big, so real, so beautiful 💖.
      That tiny spark on Insta became the beginning of the most meaningful connection I’ve ever known.
      We didn’t meet in person, we didn’t know where it was going, but somehow we just clicked 🔗.
Every day, every chat, every late-night conversation built something deeper,
something more honest, more comforting, more 'us' 🥰.
      From that first moment till now, you’ve become more than just someone I talk to.
You became my person ❤️.
The one who understands me when I don’t make sense.
      The one who makes me smile even through texts 😋.
The one I think about randomly in the middle of the day 💭.
The one I miss even after we just talked 🥺.
This isn’t just the anniversary of a message,
It’s our story, the anniversary of when fate gave me someone irreplaceable 🪐.
It’s the day a stranger started becoming my everything ❣️.
      Three years of laughter, of growth, of loving and learning, of being there for each other in ways only we can understand 💋.
You’ve seen the best and worst of me, and you’ve stayed.
You chose me. You kept choosing me.
      And I want you to know…
I’d go back and send that same emoji again a million times,
If it means I’d find you at the end of it 🤤.
So here’s to the “😂” that started it all,
To the “What’s there to laugh at?” that made my heart smile 😊.
      To three years of something rare and real.
To you, and everything we’ve become.
Happy third year anniversary to my baeee!!! 💖
Happy 3rd Anniversary of the Day We Met My baeee.... 🥰
      Thank you for replying.
      Thank you for staying.
      Thank you for becoming home. 🏡"></p>
